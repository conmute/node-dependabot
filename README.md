# node-dependabot

Draft. Implementing a script of dependabot for nodejs, working by provider. Starting with BitBucket

## BitBucket

A simple script for now, to setup other support we will need to create monorepository so we can manage shared code and target multiple vendors (such as gitHub/gitLab).

### Notes

**Must be used with caution!** The token pull request permision will have enough rights to:

For test purposes using Repository Token, due to Project token is a "Premium feature".
